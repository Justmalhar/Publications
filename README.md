### **Review on Parallel Approach for Lossless File Compression on CPU using OpenMP**
> **Abstract**
>
> High performance computing (HPC) has proved to be a colossal computation resource for data intensive applications that
require parallel processing for expeditious data analysis. In this paper, we analyze a parallel programming model using OpenMP
for file compression. The intent of the paper is to explore literature on the subject and to provide a high level view of the
features presented in the programming model, thus assisting lossless file compression.

### **FAST JPEG Encoding Using OpenMP**
> **Abstract**
> 
> Multi-core programming has given rise to advanced implementations in computing. Increasing number of compression
algorithms are being remodelled to utilize the multi-core computational power available at hand. In JPEG (Joint Photographic
Experts Group) compression, DCT is a computationally intensive function which bottlenecks the performance of the algorithm.
This paper presents a fast solution for DCT with the help of parallel programming, using OpenMP for the implementation on a
multi-core CPU. The results indicate that in the parallel implementation exhibits considerable speedup as compared to the serial
implementation.
